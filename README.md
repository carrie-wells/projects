# Coding Projects

## I have created four coding projects completed in the MITx PRO Women in Coding program. Learn about each project below. You can also navigate to the drop down menu on my main page to visit each repository or visit the four cards on my main page to see how each project works.

# Pac-Man Factory
This program allows the users to create multiple Pac-Men that move across the screen at different rates. The Pac-Men bounce against walls and rebound to continue moving. 
## How to Run:
Download all of the files onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into your browser. Click "Add Pacman" for each Pacman you would like to add. Click "Start Game" to watch them move around your screen.

## Future Improvements:
Create Pac-man of varying colors; Add other Pac-man related elements, like ghosts and cherries; Make the Pac-Men change direction when they hit an edge

# Eye Movement
This program allows the user to track mouse movements using a set of eyes. 
## How to Run:
Download all of the files onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into your browser. As you move your mouse across the screen, the eyes will track your movements.

## Future Improvements:
Add an entire face; add details like eye brows and eye lashes; add a different function for clicks (e.g. eyes blink or wink)

# Real Time Bus Tracker
This program tracks a bus route from the Natural History Museum to The HUB at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.
## How to Run:
Download all of the files onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into your browser. Click the title of the route, and a marker will track the route on the University of Florida campus.

## Future Improvements:
Add additional bus routes on campus; add GPS to the program to track the actual movements of the bus as it travels across campus; add times that the bus will be at each location with a tool tip that appears when you hover over a marker

# Towers of Hanoi
This traditional challenge moves 5 discs across 3 towers according to a specific set of rules.
## How to Run:
Download all of the files onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into your browser. Click "Make Move" and watch the discs move between the towers until you complete the puzzle. A completion notification will pop-up when you have finished.

## Future Improvements:
Make different color discs; allow the user to select the number of discs (e.g. 3, 4, 5); add an automated feature where the puzzle is completed with a single click
